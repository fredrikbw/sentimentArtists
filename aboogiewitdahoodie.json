In my bag now, In my bag now (Bag now)
What the fuck is that sound? (That sound)
What the fuck is that sound? (That sound)

Brought the MAC out, niggas sat down
I got shit I never had now, I could brag now
Got my bitch a Louis bag now, she could brag now
Bought my bitch a Birkin bag now, she a brat now
Now I'm sittin' in the club in a different bag now
Baby when I pick it up you gon put that ass down
Tell 'em you don't give a fuck, baby spin that ass 'round
Tell the DJ turn it up, what the fuck is that sound?
A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie and it's always foreign
Yeah I know she like my style, them other niggas borin'
When I pull up it go skrrt skrrt, that's a foreign
When I pull up on a red light, they don't want it
Yeah I came up from the mud and my baby know that
Introduced her to my plug, now she think she all that
When I first hit her up, no she never wrote back
Then I saw her at the club so I got up on that

Now every time they play this song she say "This is my shit" (This is my shit)
See the flick of my wrist (Flick of my wrist)
And I know she know wassup, baby this is my shit (This is my shit)
See the flick of my wrist (Flick of my wrist)

They know that's my bitch, that's a fact and she stuck with me
When you in my section, fill it up when my cup empty
I can't fuck with rats, that's a fact, that's a dub nigga
All about my F, can't put water over blood nigga
Trust me, it get ugly
If I wasn't gettin' money would you still want me?
If I told you I was broke would you start actin' funny?
This is all I ever wanted, you can't take it from me

Now every time they play this song, she say "This is my shit" (This is my shit)
See the flick of my wrist (Flick of my wrist)
And I know she know wassup baby this is my shit (This is my shit)
See the flick of my wrist (Flick of my wrist)

Nigga this is what that jungle do
You been plottin' nigga, wasn't you?

Yeah I started in the back, had to skip the line though
I'ma keep that shit a stack 'til my fucking time go
Niggas throw you in the shade cause they wanna shine though
Nigga throw me in the grave in a Ferragamo
Man I can't believe they killed my fucking bro Quado
Shit was so deep I had to say that with my eyes closed
That shit made me wanna treat a nigga like he John Doe
Nine on me Rondo, now that nigga John Doe

This is all I ever wanted nigga
Why would I let you take it from me nigga?
I ain't stupid, ain't no dummy nigga
A couple fingers on a couple triggers
Fuck with you, why would I fuck with you?

Fuck it, this is what that jungle do

Started, what I started
Anybody want a problem, this is my shit
Tell 'em if they want a problem I'm from Highbridge
Got a nigga with a shotgun up in my whip
Making bitches go retarded with this hard dick
Why you think my name is Artist? I'm an artist
I woke up to a ménage, I'm just being honest
I get money, if I want it, I'ma cop it
If a nigga want static let him have it
Have you ever seen a mini semi-automatic?
It go dumb like a drum, hear the beat blastin'
When it come to that fire, I'm a fucking dragon

Nigga this is what that jungle do
Nigga this is what that jungle do
You been plottin' nigga wasn't you?
I should have never even fuck with you

I was walking in the rain with my Timbs on
Stepping over puddles full of pain, it's a big storm
13 on my Balmains, it's a big storm
In the club love to make it rain
Like what nigga, we don't fuck witcha
Know I'm all about my bucks nigga, I don't trust niggas
Ever since I was a young nigga coming up nigga
Ain't nobody show me love nigga, so it's fuck niggas

I remember being in the hood with you
I still think about you

Fuck all the phony shit
Fuck it, I'm stuck on some doly shit
Had a knife in my back when I wrote this shit
I look back and I laugh when I noticed it
I shoot up and lean back on some Kobe shit
They don't know how to pass on some Kobe shit
Should've listened, my mom always told me this
I was only 13 when she told me this
Watch who you fuck with
And never ever trust a nigga for nothing
Even if you feel like you really love her
Don't ever tell that bitch that you really love her
'Cause that's when she's gon' make you feel like you nothing
And that's when you gon' start to feel like you buggin'
I wish I would've never told you wassup
And I wish I never even told you pull up

Got me saying, "What's good with you?"
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you

I hope that I never see you again
I don't wanna put up with it
I don't wanna fuck with it
I'ma just send you this letter whenever I'm done with it
I know you gon' read it
I called you a bitch at the end, I don't know if I mean it
I ain't wanna believe what my niggas was telling me
My nigga I shoulda cheated
And now I feel stupid
I shoulda knew better than this
Wasn't the right way to do it
I should've been choosing the money instead of a bitch
Fuck it cause I'm gettin' to it
Just watch how I do it
I knew I was ready for this
Bitch I'ma focus on music
You love how I do it
I knew I was ready for this

Got me saying, "What's good with you?"

You got me singing all these love songs

But I'm going up though, I just hope I don’t lose it
Bitches pickin' and choosin'
But I know what's up tho, I already been through it
We coulda been balling together
Hit up the mall, it's whatever
You know that I started from nothing
Them bitches was fed up

You said that you was gon' ride forever and ever
You told me forever and ever

Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the .9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher
She looked at my wrist and she looked at a hundred thousand

Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
