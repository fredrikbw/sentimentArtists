I don't need your sympathy
There's nothing you can say or do for me
And I don't want a miracle
You'll never change for no one
And I hear your reasons why
Where did you sleep last night?
And was she worth it, was she worth it?

'Cause I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go

So you feel misunderstood
Baby have I got news for you
On being used, I could write the book
But you don't wanna hear about it
'Cause I've been losing sleep
And you've been going cheap
She ain't worth half of me, it's true
Now I'm telling you, that

I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go

Come hell or waters high
You'll never see me cry
This is our last goodbye, it's true
I'm telling you, now

I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go
Now I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go

Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember long ago
Another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself
And softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls
Were coming from afar

They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute
Seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life
And none of us prepared to die
And I’m not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons
Almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There’s no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we’re old and grey, Fernando
Since many years
I haven’t seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night
We crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight
For freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There’s no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There’s no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Yes, if had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you and you'd stay

I don't know why I did the things I did
I don't know why I said the things I said
Pride's like a knife, it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes

I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry, but baby

If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you, you'd stay
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time

My world was shattered, I was torn apart
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
When you walked out that door I swore that I didn't care
But I lost everything, darlin', then and there

Too strong to tell you I was sorry
Too proud to tell you I was wrong
I know that I was blind and darlin'

If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you and you'd stay
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do

If I could turn back time
(If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time
(If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time
Oh, baby

I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry, but

If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
And maybe, maybe, maybe you'd stay
If I could reach the stars

After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love

No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you
It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one, oh

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

What am I supposed to do?
Sit around and wait for you?
Well, I can't do that
And there's no turning back
I need time to move on
I need love to feel strong
'Cause I've had time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you, oh

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

Well, I know that I'll get through this
'Cause I know that I am strong
I don't need you anymore
Oh, I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
No, I don't need you anymore

Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

Does he love me?
I wanna know
How can I tell if he loves me so?

(Is it in his eyes?) Oh, no, you'll be deceived
(Is it in his sighs?) Oh, no, he'll make believe
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss (That's where it is, oh, yeah)
(Or is it in his face?) Oh, no, it's just his charms
(In his warm embrace?) Oh, no, that's just his arms
If you want to know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss (That's where it is)
Oho, it's in his kiss (That's where it is)


Oh-oho, hug him, squeeze him tight
Find out what you wanna know
If it's love, if it really is
It's there in his kiss

(How about the way he acts?)
Oh, no, that's not the way
You're not list'nin' to all I say
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss (That's where it is)
Oho, it's in his kiss (That's where it is)

Oh-oho, hug him, squeeze him tight
Find out what you wanna know
If it's love, if it really is
It's there in his kiss

(How about the way he acts?)
Oh, no, that's not the way
And you're not listening to all that I say
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss (That's where it is)

Oho, it's in his kiss (That's where it is)
Oh, yeah (It's in his), kiss (That's where it is)
Ooh, it's in his kiss (That's where it is)
It's in his kiss (That's where it is)
Oooh, it's in his kiss (That's where it is)
Ooohooo, oho, in his (It's in his kiss) kiss (That's where it is)
Ohohoho, it's in his kiss (That's where it is)
That's where it is (That's where it is)
Oh, it's in his kiss (That's where it is)
